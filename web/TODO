??? create user with following rights: users(CRUD), products(CRUD), stores(CRUD), reviews(CRUD), order(CRU), carts(CRUD),

Back-end:

Add product_id and order_id (cant use user_email like in cart bcs user can have multiple orders, as opposed to just one cart) column to order as well (show product managers the order they are supposed to deliver with Group by order_id)
Consider synchronization between tables (updating nr of transactions of store when a new order is created etc)

Front-end:

-change / delete account:
-adapt to fit user details page
-change from html s to php s
-make sure to not allow delete or update buttons to affect different accounts 

user details page: 
-remove password from session?
-add button for rights elevation ("create store" button)
-add button for change pass / change name
-add button for delete acc (redirect to already built page, with user details in session)\
-add list of orders (separate in_transit orders from rest)
-add star score for finished or failed orders 

store management page:
-add buttons for product listing / order listing in navbar (display content based on what is selected)
-add buttons for order status change 
-list all STORE RELATED products
-add ADD button at the top and a pop-up(bootstrap?) form for providing info abt new product
-add edit button for every row
-add remove button for every row

cart details page:
