BD:
vezi de ce pe products id-ul sare din 10 in 10 (e de la clearDB) si cum remediez asta (daca e cazul?)
DONE scrierile pe baza de date trebuie sa fie facute cu tranzactii !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
??? create user with following rights: users(CRUD), carts(CRUD), reviews(CRUD), order(CRU), stores(R), products(R)
??? create user with following rights: users(CRUD), products(CRUD), stores(CRUD), reviews(CRUD), order(CRU), carts(CRUD),


Back-end:

Save info about user after login in $_SESSION
Remember to call session_destroy on logout (work with session ids)
Consider synchronization between tables (updating nr of transactions of store when a new order is created etc)


Front-end:
login / register:
-do redirects for login / register failed / succesful DONE

Home:
-Use user's email as identifier for table `carts` DONE
-with add to cart button DONE
-with link towards product details page (pass product params with url for generic php file)
-figure out filtering (look at asort())

user details page: 
-add button for rights elevation ("create store" button)
-add button for change pass / change name
-add button for delete acc (redirect to already built page, with user details in session)\
-add list of orders (separate in_transit orders from rest)
-add star score for finished or failed orders 

product detail page:
-generic page with parameters from url 

store management page:
-add buttons for product listing / order listing in navbar (display content based on what is selected)
-add buttons for order status change 
-list all STORE RELATED products
-add ADD button at the top 
-add edit button for every row
-add remove button for every row
-Reviews info

cart details page:
-list products from cart
-add remove button (removes 1 from cart)
-add remove all button (removes all specific type of product from cart)
-add send order button (check and dont allow to order more than what s in stock)

use error_reporting(0); on everything(?)
consider adding an if((!isset($_SESSION["login"])) exit; at the start of every page
